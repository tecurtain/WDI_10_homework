Personal Festival Management System (PFMS) - Working Title

Users create database of festivals or events they have been to or would like to go to.
These are then added to the users profile.

Contained within the festival they want to go to would be the: Name, Location, Date, Ticket Cost, Images they have found, events they do not want to miss.

Contained within the festival they've gone to would be the: Name, Location, Date, Ticket Cost, Images they have taken, memorable events.

Both Before/After states would have access to add other users they have attended the event or are planning on attending the event with.
